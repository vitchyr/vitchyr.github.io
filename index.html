          Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) can meta-train policies that adapt to
          new tasks with orders of magnitude less data than standard RL, but
          meta-training itself is costly and time-consuming. If we can
          meta-train on offline data, then we can reuse the same static dataset,
          labeled once with rewards for different tasks, to meta-train policies
          that adapt to a variety of new tasks at meta-test time. Although this
          capability would make meta-RL a practical tool for real-world use,
          offline meta-RL presents additional challenges beyond online meta-RL
          or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL learns an exploration
          strategy that collects data for adapting, and also meta-trains a
          policy that quickly adapts to data from a new task. Since this policy
          was meta-trained on a fixed, offline dataset, it might behave
          unpredictably when adapting to data collected by the learned
          exploration strategy, which differs systematically from the offline
          data and thus induces distributional shift. We do not want to remove
          this distributional shift by simply adopting a conservative
          exploration strategy, because learning an exploration strategy enables
          an agent to collect better data for faster adaptation. Instead, we
          propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm, which uses offline data
          with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then collects
          additional unsupervised online data, without any reward labels to
          bridge this distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels for
          online collection, this data can be much cheaper to collect. We
          compare our method to prior work on offline meta-RL on simulated robot
          locomotion and manipulation tasks and find that using additional
          unsupervised online data collection leads to a dramatic improvement in
          the adaptive capabilities of the meta-trained policies, matching the
          performance of fully online meta-RL on a range of challenging domains
          that require generalization to new tasks.

          While reinforcement learning algorithms provide
          automated acquisition of optimal policies, practical application of
          such methods requires a number
          of design decisions, such as manually designing
          reward functions that not only define the task, but
          also provide sufficient shaping to accomplish it.
          In this paper, we discuss a new perspective on
          reinforcement learning, recasting it as the problem of inferring
          actions that achieve desired outcomes, rather than a problem of
          maximizing rewards. To solve the resulting outcome-directed inference
          problem, we establish a novel variational
          inference formulation that allows us to derive a
          well-shaped reward function which can be learned
          directly from environment interactions. From the
          corresponding variational objective, we also derive a new
          probabilistic Bellman backup operator reminiscent of the standard
          Bellman backup
          operator and use it to develop an off-policy algorithm to solve
          goal-directed tasks. We empirically
          demonstrate that this method eliminates the need
          to design reward functions and leads to effective
          goal-directed behaviors.

          Standardized evaluation measures have aided in the progress of
          machine learning approaches in disciplines such as computer vision and
          machine translation. In this paper, we make the case that robotic
          learning would also benefit from benchmarking, and present the
          "REPLAB" platform for benchmarking vision-based manipulation tasks.
          REPLAB is a reproducible and self-contained hardware stack (robot arm,
          camera, and workspace) that costs about 2000 USD, occupies a cuboid of
          size 70x40x60 cm, and permits full assembly within a few hours.
          Through this low-cost, compact design, REPLAB aims to drive wide
          participation by lowering the barrier to entry into robotics and to
          enable easy scaling to many robots. We envision REPLAB as a framework
          for reproducible research across manipulation tasks, and as a step in
          this direction, we define a template for a grasping benchmark
          consisting of a task definition, evaluation protocol, performance
          measures, and a dataset of 92k grasp attempts. We implement, evaluate,
          and analyze several previously proposed grasping approaches to
          establish baselines for this benchmark. Finally, we also implement and
          evaluate a deep reinforcement learning approach for 3D reaching tasks
          on our REPLAB platform.

          Can we use reinforcement learning to learn general-purpose policies
          that can perform a wide range of different tasks, resulting in
          flexible and reusable skills? Contextual policies provide this
          capability in principle, but the representation of the context
          determines the degree of generalization and expressivity. Categorical
          contexts preclude generalization to entirely new tasks.
          Goal-conditioned policies may enable some generalization, but cannot
          capture all tasks that might be desired. In this paper, we propose
          goal distributions as a general and broadly applicable task
          representation suitable for contextual policies. Goal distributions
          are general in the sense that they can represent any state-based
          reward function when equipped with an appropriate distribution class,
          while the particular choice of distribution class allows us to trade
          off expressivity and learnability. We develop an off-policy algorithm
          called distribution-conditioned reinforcement learning (DisCo RL) to
          efficiently learn these policies. We evaluate DisCo RL on a variety of
          robot manipulation tasks and find that it significantly outperforms
          prior methods on tasks that require generalization to new goal
          distributions.

          For an autonomous agent to fulfill a wide range of user-specified goals
          at test time, it must be able to learn broadly applicable and
          general-purpose skill repertoires. Furthermore, to provide the requisite
          level of generality, these skills must handle raw sensory input such as
          images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that acquires such
          general-purpose skills by combining unsupervised representation learning
          and reinforcement learning of goal-conditioned policies. Since the
          particular goals that might be required at test-time are not known in
          advance, the agent performs a self-supervised "practice" phase where it
          imagines goals and attempts to achieve them. We learn a visual
          representation with three distinct purposes: sampling goals for
          self-supervised practice, providing a structured transformation of raw
          sensory inputs, and computing a reward signal for goal reaching. We also
          propose a retroactive goal relabeling scheme to further improve the
          sample-efficiency of our method. Our off-policy algorithm is efficient
          enough to learn policies that operate on raw image observations and
          goals for a real-world robotic system, and substantially outperforms
          prior techniques.

          Planning methods can solve temporally extended sequential decision
          making problems by composing simple behaviors. However, planning
          requires suitable abstractions for the states and transitions, which
          typically need to be designed by hand. In contrast, model-free
          reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire behaviors from low-level
          inputs directly, but often struggles with temporally extended tasks.
          Can we utilize reinforcement learning to automatically form the
          abstractions needed for planning, thus obtaining the best of both
          approaches? We show that goal-conditioned policies learned with RL can
          be incorporated into planning, so that a planner can focus on which
          states to reach, rather than how those states are reached. However,
          with complex state observations such as images, not all inputs
          represent valid states. We therefore also propose using a latent
          variable model to compactly represent the set of valid states for the
          planner, so that the policies provide an abstraction of actions, and
          the latent variable model provides an abstraction of states. We
          compare our method with planning-based and model-free methods and find
          that our method significantly outperforms prior work when evaluated on
          image-based robot navigation and manipulation tasks that require
          non-greedy, multi-staged behavior.

          For an autonomous agent to fulfill a wide range of user-specified goals
          at test time, it must be able to learn broadly applicable and
          general-purpose skill repertoires. Furthermore, to provide the requisite
          level of generality, these skills must handle raw sensory input such as
          images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that acquires such
          general-purpose skills by combining unsupervised representation learning
          and reinforcement learning of goal-conditioned policies. Since the
          particular goals that might be required at test-time are not known in
          advance, the agent performs a self-supervised "practice" phase where it
          imagines goals and attempts to achieve them. We learn a visual
          representation with three distinct purposes: sampling goals for
          self-supervised practice, providing a structured transformation of raw
          sensory inputs, and computing a reward signal for goal reaching. We also
          propose a retroactive goal relabeling scheme to further improve the
          sample-efficiency of our method. Our off-policy algorithm is efficient
          enough to learn policies that operate on raw image observations and
          goals for a real-world robotic system, and substantially outperforms
          prior techniques.

        Model-free deep reinforcement learning has been shown to exhibit good
        performance in domains ranging from video games to simulated robotic
        manipulation and locomotion. However, model-free methods are known to
        perform poorly when the interaction time with the environment is
        limited, as is the case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this
        paper, we study how maximum entropy policies trained using soft
        Q-learning can be applied to real-world robotic manipulation. The
        application of this method to real-world manipulation is facilitated by
        two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft Q-learning can
        learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies represented
        by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies learned
        with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that
        the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the
        divergence between the composed policies.

        Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful, general tool for
        learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is often
        impractical large for solving challenging real-world problems, even with 
        off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning.
        We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of
        goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained
        with model-free learning and used for model-based control.
        TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they
        leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very
        efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds
        that of direct model-based RL methods.

        Practical deployment of reinforcement learning methods must contend with
        the fact that the training process itself can be unsafe for the robot.
        In this paper, we consider the specific case of a mobile robot learning
        to navigate an a priori unknown environment while avoiding collisions.
        We present an uncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm that
        estimates the probability of collision together with a statistical
        estimate of uncertainty. We evaluate our method on a simulated and
        real-world quadrotor, and a real-world RC car.

        Training an agent to use past memories to adapt to new tasks and
        environments is important for lifelong learning algorithms.
        We propose a reinforcement learning method that addresses the
        limitations of methods like BPTT and truncated BPTT by training
        a critic to estimate truncated gradients and by saving and loading
        hidden states outputted by recurrent neural networks.
        We present results showing that our algorithm can learn long-term
        dependencies while avoiding the computational constraints of BPTT.

          Designed and created gloves that allow users to type on any hard
          surface as if they were using a QWERTY keyboard. The gloves recognize
          the standard QWERTY keyboard layout by recognizing which finger is
          pressed via push buttons, and how bent the finger is via flex sensors.
          We combined knowledge of analog circuit design, serial communication
          protocols, and embedded programming to implement this project.
